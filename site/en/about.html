				Hi, my name is Marcel. I´m a software developer. I live and work in the south of Germany.</p>
			<p>
				Since the late 90´s my heart belongs to software development and in my career i was active
				as developer, architect and consultant. For many years i developed software with .NET and C#.
				Mostly web solutions with ASP.NET MVC and the Web API, for websites, webapps, microservices,
				backend and domain logic, or solutions for Windows using WPF (or Windows.Forms, in a long
				forgotten past).
			<p>
				Since 2016 i also did a lot of JavaScript-related web development, because
				i like the more functional-driven approach of JS and i like the nature of the modern web. Of
				course i´m also a friend of TypeScript, since a strong-typed JS can be rather helpful in the
				backend corners. I also did different native mobile development projects on iOS and Android,
				over the years.
			</p>
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides this main interests i also meet with friends, to sit in the sun and drink some cold beer.
				If the sun don´t shine i practise one of my favorite hobbies and play strategy board games or join
				some pub quiz. Since i would definitely call myself a cineaste, you also can find me often in movie
				theaters. As a child of the internet generation i spend a lot of time to read forums, blogs, Twitter
				and so on. But sometimes i have to “Esc” from there and get some more relaxing input. Then i read
				some books, printed on good ol´ real paper.
