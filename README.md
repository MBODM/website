# MBODM Website

This repo contains my rather simple http://mbodm.com website.

### General info
I use this GitHub repo for my website, just for some easier maintaining. This repo is public. But since my site is rather simple structured (no backend pre-rendering or anyting like that, just simple static hosting), the whole source of my site is sent to the browser anyway. So it does not really matter, if this repo is private or public. 😉 Oh, and please do not judge my work here that harsh, since it´s just some sidework in my sparse free time, so i have something done with my domain.

### License info
I used some typical GitHub MIT predefined license for my site. Feel free to reuse any code from my site. Since i am not a multibillion-dollar-company, there is not much to protect. 😁 But: Said MIT license is valid for the whole source code (but "only" the code). Please have a close look at the license file ("_[license.txt](site/img/license.txt)_") inside the image folder ("_[site/img](site/img)_"). Since the website contains a font, icons and a photo, you find specific license informations for them, inside said [site/img/license.txt](site/img/license.txt) file.

#### Have fun.
